# Common

This is the common config that I include in all of my other configs. It includes:

- Secret-based Wifi configuration
- Wifi RSSI sensor
- API with password
- Logger
- OTA with password
- Device status binary sensor

## Setup

1. Copy `packages/` into your local ESPHome directory.
1. Open `secrets.yaml` and enter your Wifi connection info.
